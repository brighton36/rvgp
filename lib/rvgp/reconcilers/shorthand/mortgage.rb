    module Shorthand
      # This reconciler shorthand will automatically allocate the the escrow, principal, and interest components of a
      # mortage debit, into constituent accounts. The amounts of each, are automatically calculated, based on the loan
      # terms, and taking the residual leftover, into a escrow account, presumably for taxes and insurance to be paid by
      # the mortgage provider.
      #
      # Its important to note, that a single reconciler rule will match every mortgage payment encountered. And, that
      # each of these payments will generate four transactions in the output file:
      # - The initial payment, which, will be transferred to an :intermediary_account
      # - A principal payment, which, will be debited from the :intermediary account, to the :payee_principal
      # - An interest payment, which, will be debited from the :intermediary account, to the :payee_interest
      # - An escrow payment, which, will be debited from the :intermediary account, to the :escrow_account
      # You can see details of this expansion under the example section below.
      #
      # With regards to the :escrow_account, It's likely that you'll want to either (choose one):
      # - Manually transcribe debits from the escrow account, to escrow payees, in your project's
      #   ./journal/property-name-escrow.journal, based on when your mortgage provider alerts you to these payments.
      # - Download a csv from your mortgage provider, of your escrow account (if they offer one), and define a
      #   reconciler to allocate escrow payments.
      #
      # The shorthand parameters we support are:
      # - **label** [String] - This is a prefix, used in the description of Principal, Interest, and Escrow transactions
      # - **principal** [Commodity] - The mortgage principal
      # - **rate** [Float] - The mortgage rate
      # - **payee_principal** [String] - The account to ascribe principal payments to
      # - **payee_interest** [String] - The account to ascribe interest payments to
      # - **escrow_account** [String] - Te account to ascribe escrow payments to
      # - **intermediary_account** [String] - The account to ascribe intermediary payments to, from the source account,
      #   before being assigned to principal, interest, and escrow break-outs.
      # - **start_at_installment_number** [Integer] - The installment number, of the first matching transaction,
      #   encountered by this shorthand. Year one of a mortgage would start at zero. Subsequent annual reconcilers would
      #   be expected to define an installment number from which calculations can automatically pick-up the work
      #   from years prior.
      # - **additional_payments** [Array<Hash>] - Any additional payments, to apply to the principal, can be listed
      #   here. This field is expected to be an array of hashes, which, are composed of the following fields:
      #   - **before_installment** [Integer] - The payment number, before which, this :amount should apply
      #   - **amount** [Float] - A float that will be deducted from the principal. No commodity is necessary to
      #     delineate, as we assume the same commodity as the :principle.
      # - **override_payments** [Array<Hash>] - I can't explain why this is necessary. But, it seems that the interest
      #   calculations used by some mortgage providers ... aren't accurate. This happened to me, at least. The
      #   calculation being used was off by a penny, on a single installment. And, I didn't care enough to call the
      #   institution and figure out why. So, I added this feature, to allow an override of the automatic calculation,
      #   with the amount provided. This field is expected to be an array of hashes, which are composed of the following
      #   fields:
      #   - **at_installment** [Integer] - The payment number to assert the :interest value.
      #   - **interest** [Float] - The amount of the interest calculation. No commodity is neccessary to delineate, as
      #     we assume the same commodity as the :principle.
      #
      # # Example
      # Here's how this shorthand might be used in your reconciler:
      # ```
      # ...
      # - match: /AcmeFinance Servicing/
      #   to_shorthand: Mortgage
      #   shorthand_params:
      #     label: 1-8-1 Yurakucho Dori Mortgage
      #     intermediary_account: Personal:Expenses:Banking:MortgagePayment:181Yurakucho
      #     payee_principal: Personal:Liabilities:Mortgage:181Yurakucho
      #     payee_interest: Personal:Expenses:Banking:Interest:181Yurakucho
      #     escrow_account: Personal:Assets:AcmeFinance:181YurakuchoEscrow
      #     principal: 260000.00
      #     rate: 0.0499
      #     start_at_installment_number: 62
      # ...
      # ```
      # And here's how that will reconcile one of your payments, in your build:
      # ```
      # ...
